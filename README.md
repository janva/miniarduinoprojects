# Arduino mini project

Needed a break from what i usually do so I got me self an [Arduino uno](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3)  along with a kit of components. This is one of does feel-good-follow-along-minimal-effort-maximum-satisfaction-projects. The aim is to get familiar with the arduino by following some tutorials and maybe learn something new on the way. It's been more then a while since i did any electronics. The Arduino language uses C-like syntax. C is not new to me but I haven't used C for some time now. The aim is not write perfect code for now rather i want to do a bunch of small projects in a limited time span. Some of the code will probably be taken straight from the tutorials.
